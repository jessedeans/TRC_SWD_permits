# Collect Salt Water Disposal Permits in Texas

This sciprt queries the Texas Rail Road Commission(RRC) Underground Injection Control (UIC)
database for permitted wells in District 10. It will create two files. File one is the 
query results generated by the RRC, and is generated in the first minute. File two is 
the permit detail for every UIC number, and will take longer.

## Set-Up / Usage / How to 
Script was written and desinged to be ran from Spyder on Windows. Firefox must be installed 
on the machine to run the code. The code will open an automated Firefox window, closing the 
window will cause the code to crash, minmizing the window is fine. In future versions of this 
code, the window may be hidden, but I have left it visible as a quick way to monitor the codes 
progress.
